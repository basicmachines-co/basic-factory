# basic-memory: Project Documentation

## Overview

basic-memory represents a fundamental shift in how humans and AI collaborate on projects. It combines the time-tested Zettelkasten note-taking method with modern knowledge graph technology and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create something uniquely powerful: a system that both humans and AI can naturally work with, each in their own way.

Built on SQLite for simplicity and portability, basic-memory solves a critical challenge in AI-human collaboration: maintaining consistent, rich context across conversations while keeping information organized and accessible. It's like having a shared brain that both AI and humans can read and write to naturally.

Key innovations:
- **AI-Native Knowledge Structure**: Uses entities and relations that match how LLMs think
- **Human-Friendly Interface**: Everything is readable/writable as markdown text
- **Project Isolation**: Load only relevant context for focused discussions
- **Local-First**: Your knowledge stays in SQLite databases you control
- **Tool-Driven**: Leverages MCP for seamless AI interaction with your knowledge

Think of it as a bridge between human note-taking and AI thinking patterns. Whether you're documenting code, managing projects, or building complex systems, basic-memory helps maintain continuous, meaningful collaboration between human and AI partners.

Best of all, it follows the Basic Machines philosophy: simple, powerful tools that respect user agency and avoid vendor lock-in. No cloud dependencies, no black boxes - just a straightforward system for building shared understanding between humans and AI.

## Core Concepts

### Knowledge Graph Structure

#### Entities
Primary nodes in the knowledge graph. Each entity has:
- Unique name (identifier)
- Entity type (e.g., "person", "organization", "project")
- List of observations

Example:
```json
{
  "name": "Basic_Factory",
  "entityType": "Project",
  "observations": ["Collaborative development environment", "Uses MCP tools"]
}
```

#### Relations
Directed connections between entities, stored in active voice:
- From entity
- To entity
- Relation type

Example:
```json
{
  "from": "Basic_Memory",
  "to": "Basic_Machines",
  "relationType": "is_part_of"
}
```

#### Observations
Atomic facts about entities:
- Stored as strings
- Attached to specific entities
- Independent addition/removal
- One fact per observation

Example:
```json
{
  "entityName": "Basic_Memory",
  "observations": [
    "Uses SQLite for storage",
    "Supports project isolation",
    "Enables AI-human collaboration"
  ]
}
```

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Entities table
CREATE TABLE entities (
    name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_type TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Observations table
CREATE TABLE observations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    entity_name TEXT REFERENCES entities(name),
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Relations table
CREATE TABLE relations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    from_entity TEXT REFERENCES entities(name),
    to_entity TEXT REFERENCES entities(name),
    relation_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(from_entity, to_entity, relation_type)
);

-- Full-text search
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE entity_fts USING fts5(
    name,
    entity_type,
    observations_raw
);
```

## Project Management

### Database Structure
```
~/.basic-memory/
├── projects/
│   ├── basic-factory.db
│   ├── basic-memory.db
│   └── client-project.db
└── config.json
```

### CLI Commands
```bash
# Project management
basic-memory create project basic-factory
basic-memory switch project client-x
basic-memory list projects

# Entity management
basic-memory add entity "Basic_Memory" --type Project
basic-memory add observation "Basic_Memory" "Uses SQLite storage"
basic-memory add relation "Basic_Memory" "Basic_Machines" "is_part_of"
```

## MCP Tool Integration

### Tool Definitions
```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "load_project",
      "description": "Load a project's knowledge graph into context",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "project_name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Name of the project to load"
          }
        },
        "required": ["project_name"]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "query_knowledge",
      "description": "Query the current project's knowledge graph",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",

          }
        },
        "required": ["query"]
      }
    }

# basic-memory-webui

## Overview
basic-memory-webui is a notebook-style interface for the basic-memory knowledge graph system, enabling interactive human-AI collaboration in knowledge work. It combines the power of Zettelkasten note-taking, knowledge graphs, and AI assistance into a unique local-first tool for thought.

### Why This is Cool and Interesting
This project represents a novel approach to human-AI collaboration by:
1. **True Two-Way Knowledge Flow**: Unlike traditional AI chat interfaces, both human and AI can read and write to the same knowledge graph, creating genuine collaborative intelligence
2. **Local-First Knowledge**: Your knowledge base lives in SQLite, not in some cloud service. It's yours to control, backup, and modify
3. **Notebook-Style Interface**: Familiar to developers but revolutionized with AI collaboration - imagine Jupyter Notebooks where cells can be knowledge graphs, markdown, or AI conversations
4. **MCP Integration**: Uses Anthropic's Model Context Protocol to give AI genuine understanding of context, not just simulated responses
5. **Basic Machines Stack**: Built on our proven stack (basic-foundation, basic-components), showing how simple tools can combine into powerful systems
